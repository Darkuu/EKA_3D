### NOTE:
My project became corrupted, and unfortunately, the version I had uploaded to GitHub was outdated. To recover, I borrowed the core lesson files from a classmate and made improvements myself, which has resulted in some name mismatches in certain areas, most if not all files have been replaced with my own & i received conset from the person to borrow their project's settings. Additionally, a recent Unity update caused a few minor issues, but I believe Iâ€™ve resolved them.
